# Code Samples

This repo contains a few samples of code that I have written for both my professional career and
online coursework

### Most of this Data is Anonymized
Many identifying characteristics such as tables, companies, and field names have been changed in
order to protect the privacy of the companies I have worked for.  I have also removed the
dataframe displays from the ipython notebooks as to not show any sensitive data.
This does make it harder to read and understand what is going on, but hopefully
you can still get the gist of it.
