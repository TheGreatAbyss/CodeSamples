<h2>This repo contains a very small sample of some code that I have written in my professional career.</h2>

<h3>Most of this Data is Anonymized.</h3>
<p>Many identifying characteristics such as table, company, and field names have been changed in order to protect the privacy of the companies I have worked for.  I have also removed the dataframe displays from the ipython notebooks as to not show any sensitive data.  In all fairness this does make it harder to read and understand what is going on, but hopefully you can still get the gist of it. </p>

<h3>Most of this Work is Analyst Scripting Code</h3>
<p>Much of the code within this repo was written while working as a Data Analyst.  This means the code is written from a scripting point of view as opposed to an object oriented, production-quality perspective.  The exception to this is the Spark Scala code which is a snippet of a Data Aggregation I was in the middle of building while working as a Data Engineer</p>
